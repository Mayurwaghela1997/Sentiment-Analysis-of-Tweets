# Sentiment-Analysis-of-Tweets

The repository contains the data & code for detecting the sentiments from tweets using Deep Neural Network.

## Datasets

I used the publicly available labelled dataset of approx 162K Tweets on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/saurabhshahane/twitter-sentiment-dataset) 

The label -1 represents Negative sentiment, 1 represents Positive sentiment and 0 represents Neutral sentiment.

The below figure represents the distribution of data among each category.
